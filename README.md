# SF-Bernieware

*School project to create a modern webshop*

*by Sven Eichelberg, Henrik L. Hermann und Paul Schr√∂der*

## WHAT IS SF-Bernieware

SF-Bernieware is the renewal of the old redundant BRG webshop under the managment of the school firm Bernieware. The goal is to create a functional, modern, intuitive webshop using only pure HTML, CSS, JS. The limitations are:

* Avoiding **over-useage of HTML div elements**
* Using **only let** type variables
* Using **only arrow functions**
* Only using **AI when reasonable**

## HOW THE PROJECT CURRENTLY FUNCTIONS

  The code of SF-Bernieware is written in 4 programming languages.
  These are HTML for the basic structure of the website, CSS for styling the website, JS for functionality, like dynamic site generation and CSV as a sort of offline database which is parsed in JS.

### HTML

* #### index.html
  
* #### sub.html

* #### einzel-ansichten

### CSS

* #### index.css

* #### sub.css

* #### einzel-ansicht.css

### JS

* #### gen.js

* #### search.js

* #### wagen.js
  
* #### einzel-ansicht.js

### CSV

* #### database.csv

## THE VISION AND WHAT'S (PROBABLY) TO COME

### ISSUES

  For features currently in development or to be developed in the near future see the <a style = "color: white; " href = "https://github.com/PaulusMaulusIII/SF-Bernieware/issues">***GitHub issues section***</a>

### THE VISION

  SF-Bernieware seeks to be modern, intuitive, inclusive and efficient. The usage should be easy for each and every user and also for the admin. This should be achieved through a intuitive GUI for browsing, filtering and ordering **and** for adding new products, as well as viewing orders created by the shoppers. This could and may in the future even be achieved through a BernieWare admin Android/IOS Application, or *at least* a Web applet.
